This is dc (dibol compiler)

dc deals with dependencies between dibol sources files. As an input,
it use a file where each line give a dependencie. For example, this
file

TOTO.DBL: TITI.DBL TUTU.DBL
TUTU.DBL: TATA.DBL

means : "To compile TOTO.DBL, you'll have to compile TITI.DBL and
TUTU.DBL first. But to compile TUTU.DBL, you'll have to compile
TATA.DBL first"

The compilation of a file is divided into three parts :
	- Translation from Dibol to C
	- Indentation of the resulting source code
	- compilation with gcc

when each file has been compiled, the final binary is
produce. His name is the name of the first file without
extension.
