This document describe my first attempt to compile d2c under the cygwin environnement.
As i'm writing this document, it doesn't work yet.

cygwin can be found at http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/

Firstly, you have to install it. Take care of version of automake and autoconf.
You'll need to install automake 1.4 and autoconf 2.13. It does not work yet with
latest version (it's the same under linux). Of course, install gcc, make, binutils
to get a compiler.

Now, it's time to install required components :
Download the glib source at http://www.gtk.org . I've download the 1.2.10 version.
unpack it :
	tar zxvf glib-1.2.10.tar.gz

configure :
	cd glib-1.2.10
	./configure

before running the compilation, edit config.h and remove the 2 lines with
#define HAVE_STRSIGNAL 1

run compilation :
	make

and install
	make install


Download mysql at http://www.mysql.org
Not tested yet. I've just copy include file from linux.

We are now ready to compile d2c
	cd d2c
	./configure
	make

The compilation should fail with an undefined reference to getline
