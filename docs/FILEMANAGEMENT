This file describe the management of the file for libdibol.

There is three type of file in DIBOL :
	- sequential. They are implemented as regular file.
	- relative. They are implemented through mysql.
	- indexed. They are also implemented through mysql.

Well, there is nothing to say about sequential file...

relative and indexed file are implemented with mysql. Each file is
a table into the database DIBOL.

	A table for a relative file has the following structure :
		id	int	primary key 
		data	blob

	A table for an indexed file has the following structure :
		id	int	auto_increment primary key
		key1	char(n1)
		data1	char(n2)
		key2	char(n3)
		key3	char(n4)
		...
