No, licensing of the run-time library isn't a issue.
There is several license involved in the translator
 
dpp, dc and d2c are distributed under GPL. Basically, it means that you
can't take sources and make it a proprietary product. But you can use it
on propriatary sources. It's the same for gcc. You can compile
proprietary product with it but you can't take gcc and distribute it as
a closed-source product. The result of d2c (c source) is under your own
license.
  
rtl and ues are distributed under LGPL. You still can't distribute it as
closed-source product but you can link it with closed-source product.
It's the license for the linux C library. You can write a closed-source
product that use services of the C library (netscape, oracle, ....)
   
You can have a look at www.opensource.org for more precise explanations
