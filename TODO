If you want to help the project, take a look at this TODO list. Of course,
you can do something that is not in the list.

Theses symbols get you information about the priority i've given to the task :
(*) ASAP
(+) Must be done
(-) If i've got time

* Fix memleak
+ More documentation
+ Seek and destroy GNUism such as getline and asprintf
+ abstract SQL layer to be able to use others SQL engines
- Compile on VMS :-)
- Using C++, with operators definition, i think we can get clearer code.
