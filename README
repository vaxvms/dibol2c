	d2c : A free DIBOL to C translator
	----------------------------------

	* Presentation

	Well, if you don't known what DIBOL is, I think that this software
will not be very useful to you. Take your bike and go for a ride in the
countryside, it will be better.

	Still here ? Great, so you known what DIBOL is ! It has been written
with the DIBOL-83 manual in hands. As a result, it should conform to it but
don't be surprised if you find bugs.

	It is divided into two parts :
	* The first one is the dibol to C translator. It converts a dibol
program to a C one. The raw output of d2c isn't very clean. But if you 
use GNU indent, you'll get a better output.

	* The second part is the run-time library which contains all the C
equivalent of DIBOL RTL. You'll have to link the output of the translator
to this library in order to get a working result.

	* Contributing

	I'm looking for contributors kind enough to write me some regression
tests both for the libdibol part and the translator part.
	I'm also interested in bugs reports and patchs.

	* Other

	I'm looking for a VMS-based system in order to replace my slow
VAXstation 2000 by something faster. So, if you've got a VAX (or even 
an ALPHA ;-) that you don't use, please send it to me !
